Description: A principal components based extension to partial depedence plots 
  (PDPS) that visually summarizes the total effects of groups of predictors in 
  black-box models. The method uses PCA to explore the structure of the training 
  data, but does not intend for PCA to be a part of the model under 
  investigation.
